SCROLLABLE VIEWS

1. Motivation for using scrollable views
-- We want things placed off-screen
-- Feeds, galleries, lists etc.

2. Recyclerviews
-- Dynamically add/remove from a list
-- Can hold almost anything

3. How is it implemented
-- ViewHolder & XML
-- Adapter
-- Recyclerview

4. Observers
-- Tell the Recyclerview when to update
-- Can be updated in ranges, instead of entire list
-- notifyDataSetChanged()

5. Code example
